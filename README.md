# crashhandler
## A way on Windows to handle crashes similarly to UNIX systems
---
Really simple C/C++ header which I've always found useful, it turns `Process finished with exit code ...` to a human-readable crash signals similar to UNIX.

### Usage
Type `INIT_CRASH_HANDLER;` on the top of your main function to initialize it.<br>
Enjoy your crash signals!
